                A finding I made is, if you've pushed, and pulled an unsigned image before enabling Cosign's 'Allow only verified images to be deployed.' Rule
                you'll still be able to pull that unsigned image that was pulled before the config was set.
                I initially thought that it first checks that the image exists locally, before it does the pull/hits the verification check.
                However deleting the image locally and pulling the image again did not fail. Perhaps there's a marker in the registry for when the config was turned on.
                All other unsigned images that is pushed after enabling the configuration will fail pulling.
